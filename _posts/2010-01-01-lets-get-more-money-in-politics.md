title: Let's Get More Money in Politics
categories: [Politics]

If you ask someone, especially on the left, about money in politics they'll often say that there's simply too much. It's one of those things that is that so oft-repeat that it has just become common it you don't really need to think about it. It's just common wisdom, which is exactly what makes me suspicious if there's any wisdom at all behind it.

It has become common wisdom, so people don't even have to think about it before repeating it.

In 2008, the presidential election was cost, in total, about $2.4 billion. 

What's the value of having the right president, and does more money produce a better candidate.

If you gave all 300 million Americans $100 "Democracy Bucks" each, that would cost a total of 

Would this be a better system? It seems like it to me. The total value of the Democracy Bucks would drown out the voices of even the weathiest people and special interests, and I think most people would say that that's a good thing.


$30 billion is a lot of money. There's no doubt about that. But what's the value of having the right president? Well, in 2009 that number was about $3 trillion. Now, I know there are a lot of factors that go into the federal budget (specifically Congress), but I think it's fair to say that the president has a significant effect on it. So, is it worth it to spend $30 billion to get a better president. Even if the "better" president made the budget only 1% more effective, the Democracy Bucks would pay for themselves.

And, to be clear, the federal budget is a tiny faction of the total number of hugely important decisions the president is involved in. The president, nearly unilaterally, has the ability to invade other countries and cause war. I'm focusing on the budget not because it's most important, but because it's easily quantifiable.
