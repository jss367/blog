What I learned about senses from building a robot


Building a robot was a really interesting. It really helped solidify the notion of sensors for me, especially in humans. Eyes are electro-magnetic wave sensors, in particular in what we call the "optical band".


My robot wasn't able to determine when it's battery was low - it just suddenly died. But I'm able to tell when I need more energy - I get hungry. So even though we don't think of that as a sensor, it clearly is. In fact, there are sensors all over your body. Clearly you have them in your sense of feel, and that's already accounted for. But you have internal sensors as well, and I think that's something very different than feel. For example, you can tell when you're stomache is upset. There are a lot more sensor than just the five that people talk about.
