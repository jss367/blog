My lame thoughts on aliensâ€¦ 
Unless they're aquatic, they'll be similar. Binocular vision. Predators and prey 
Had we not had an asteroid impact would we ever have very intelligent life? 
Free energy from the sun, so most likely
Probably won't use chloroplasts
Plants likely not to be green - depends on the sun type, 
They might be able to fly though
They'll have the same logic
