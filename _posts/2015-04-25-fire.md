title: "Fire"

Fire - there have never been humans without controlled fire. Homo erectus had fire, and you can see it in their much smaller teeth because they did lots of chewing. Gorillas spend about half thru lives chewing. I remember trying to chew up food in the woods. A researcher tried to chew all the same food as a gorilla but couldn't. 
This also means no human has ever discovered fire, because there has never been a group of humans who didn't already know about it. I wonder if it ever has been lost though. 
We might be able to get by today with only raw food - with our highly evolved foods, but not with natural foods
Maybe the sentinelese haven't mastered the control of fire? So this would mean fire is lost and rediscovered
The Europeans recorded the jarawa people as being the only group of people in the world, other than Tasmanian Aborigines, that didnâ€™t know how to create fire, the depended on lightning strikes and preserving the embers from previous fires.
