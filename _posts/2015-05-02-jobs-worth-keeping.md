title: "What Is a Good Job"
---

As automation increases and the economy changes, we're seeing more and more examples of jobs disappearing. Is this a good thing? It is good for certain jobs, such as those that are dangerous or physically demanding, to be replaced by machines?

There's lots of concern about AI taking away jobs.
I think before we criticize AI (or anything else) too much for taking jobs away, we should ask if they *are* good jobs? They seem to not be considered good jobs while we have them, but all of a sudden once something is going to take them away they are now "good jobs"? Can we put together a list beforehand so we can agree on this?

What is a good job? The left has forced upon us a clear example of what is a bad job: working at an Amazon warehouse, but what is a good job? For those who work at Amazon warehouses, who an economist might call an unskilled laborer. So, what's a good job?
