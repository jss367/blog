title: "What Is a Good Job"
---

What is a good job? The left has forced upon us a clear example of what is a bad job: working at an Amazon warehouse, but what is a good job? For those who work at Amazon warehouses, who an economist might call an unskilled laborer. So, what's a good job? 

I think before we criticize AI (or anything else) too much for taking jobs away, we should ask if they *are* good jobs? They seem to not be considered good jobs while we have them, but all of a sudden once something is going to take them away they are now "good jobs"? Can we put together a list beforehand so we can agree on this?
