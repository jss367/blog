Should people ever be anything other than people? I know it is common to talk of aborigines, but I absolutely cringe at the term. They, and there I, prefer the term aboriginal people. why do I cringe? because I have been taught that they don't prefer it, but if I hadn't been, I wouldn't. Should we characterize people by defining characteristics? Isn't a blacksmith more than just a blacksmith? is it just when the characteristic is bad? should we stop saying murderer? sounds that be person who murdered? why don't I cringe at the word slavery? surely that should be enslaved person, right? 

Something that's done to you (enslaved) is not your identity, (slave). Something that you do (musician) is not all of your identity either
