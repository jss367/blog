title: "FBI Files and Conspiracy Theories"
---


Here are [663 pages of FBI information](https://vault.fbi.gov/Elvis%20Presley%20/Elvis%20Presley%20Part%201%20of%2012/view) on Elvis Presley. The notion that "there are secret files" on some topic is usually used to justify some conspiracy. Here's an example of 663 pages of "secret FBI files" that yield little of interest. Most are news clippings. Some are weird, such as the letter to FBI Director about how sexual Elvis concerts are. I don't really understand why this was worth mentioning to the director of the FBI, but apparently it was. Yes, there was more concern about the sexualization of society, but it still seems pretty lame to me.
