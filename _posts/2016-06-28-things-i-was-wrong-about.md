title:  Things I've Changed My Mind On
excerpt: Vaccines, GMP, the Internet
---

These are things I was wrong about.



Things I was wrong about:
The effect of the Internet on misinformation
- The impact of free, accessible information has been so much less than I would have expected

The effect of the internet and the easy access to information (google, wikipedia) on the amount of incorrect information in public and private discourse.

I have heard so many things that are one Google search away from being completely correctly. For example, I heard an entire health lecture about 98.6, and the lecturer was so concerned with this specific number that that was the name of the lecture. It might have been good for him to Google “standard body temperature” and learn that it’s actually 98.2 degrees. 98.6 degrees is from a rounding made in celsius (37 celsius is 98.6 fahrenheit). The real range is something like 97 to 99 Fahrenheit.

Another time someone told me how important it was to have local honey to prevent allergies. I googled “local honey allergies” and the first result (double check) stated clearly that it was not. This has been studied, and the studies have been very good.

Another one that I hear over and over and over again, is that the breakdown of communication is 55% how you say it, etc. This is a mantra in government training, and it is false in the generalized case in which it is used. I hear over and over about how this applies to all communication. This, despite the hard work of the author, who devoted the front page of his website to explaining how this is a myth. He found these results in a very specific circumstance and to generalize it to all communication is completely false.



Things I was wrong about: impact of body cameras. 2016 election? Right the left knew what they were doing (Clinton going for Georgia and Arizona). No one I've talked to has been affected by the results. Most opinions are reality invariant


Fruit juice

I thought the aquatic ape theory was good until I researched it more.


Vaccines

GMO



Thingsi was wrong about: Alvin toffler in book future shock 1970 said because if information overload we would over simplify the world as it got more complex and just confirm our biases
