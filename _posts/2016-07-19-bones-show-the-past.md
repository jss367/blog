title: "Bones show the past, not the present"
---

Bones show a creature's past, not its present. The first walking humanoids would have had hips not for walking upright, but for walking on all fours. THe order would have gone like this. They had wide hips, ideal for walking on all fours, when it started to become more advantageous to walk upright. They were certainly able to do this in their current bodies, but their skeletal structure wasn't ideal for this. So they started to walk upright more and more and those with skeletal structures more adapted towards this were slowly favored over those who were. So, after many, many generations, the skeletons started to appear more adapted towards walking upright. But this was generations and generations *after* it first became advantageous to do so. That's because bones show an optimized body plan for how to get to today, not for how to live today.
