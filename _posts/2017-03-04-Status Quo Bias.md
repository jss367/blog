title: "Status Quo Bias"
---

I believe the status quo bias, that is, a preference for things that already exist, is the strongest, and possibly least discusses, bias of all. I see it so commonly but it's rarely included on a list of biases. 

Why don't people wear their seatbelts on buses? At the risk of sounding trite, I think the answer is "because they don't", or, at least, "because they didn't yesterday". If you ask someone, you might hear some specious claim about the number of accidents that buses are in, but let me ask you this. If due to advancements in car safety technology dropped the accident level to whatever it is with buses, would people stop wearing seat belts in the same situations (e.g. mostly city driving) when in a car? No. It would still be unthinkable to not wear a perfect seatbelt. By the way, I've also noticed on long distances buses running on the highway people still don't wear seatbelts. I've argued before that [most arguments people make to explain their reason are almost completely ex post rationalizations and mostly wrong](). Because people just say the first argument that comes to their mind that sounds true (in a Kahneman system 1 way). Or you might hear something about how the seat in front of you is closer to it's less dangerious. Again, this is complete nonsense - no one does these measurements and uses the same logic for cars.

People don't wear seatbelts in buses simple because that's what they're used it. It's complete status quo bias.


Another example is the [complexity of language](). Why do we put up with language this complex? Well, as I argued earlier, partly it's because we learn most languages as children. But also it's the status quo.

Status Quo bias might be more of an effect than a bias in its own right. In many ways, it's a manifestation of the bias that people are unhappy about a loss more than they are happy about a gain of the same value. So in this case, there is a status quo so any reduction from it will be condidered a loss.
But this wouldn't fully explain the seatbelt in buses situation, where there is no loss.



The fear of new weapons vs nuclear weapons


Status quo bias + fear of technology
Would we ban cars, motorcycles? 
Anything that's been killing us for a long time is OK. Anything new is bad
Nuclear weapons and icbms get little press, but and ai gun that could shoot ten bullets wins get so much
Icbms delivery tens of thousands of deaths anywhere in the world in 15 minutes


Status quo bias - alcohol vs marijuana
Accepting all crazy views if they’re called religious.

Status quo bias - ancient Greeks thought writing was decadent… We'd lose the ability to remember.
Against phones, etc. 

Status quo bias - we have a base in guantanamo bay


Status quo bias. Why did it take women so long to enter the work force? We haven't been hunting and gathering for a long time.


The difference between phone books and Facebook are possible the most best examples of status quo bias. A phone book is a list of everyone's names with their phone numbers and email addresses, yet no one seems concerned. I remember someone telling me, with horror, that people might be able to post their addresses on Facebook, and how horrible that would be. Meanwhile, phone books.

There are certainly difference between these two. But if you disagree, just take a moment to think on whether the status quo bias might be affecting you.


Status quo bias - distribution of nuclear weapons. Especially as the stakes get higher

Status quo bias - the current jobs are the right ones. There’s always concern about talking away current jobs, but no one suggests bringing back old ones. Let’s say you’re building a technology that eliminates checkout cashiers, which is already going on. I find that I always have to answer for that. No one suggests bringing back elevator operators. What’s the difference? Given this new technology, both jobs are not needed. So why employ one and not the other? Because the one is the status quo. There’s nothing inherently correct about the today. Should we bring back elevator operators? If you ignore the baseline of today, you would never say “we shouldn’t have these jobs (elevator operators and telephone switchers) but we should have these (cashier)”.
Some of this is because of change, but I think there’s something far more significant and universal at the bottom of it all, and that’s the status quo bias.


Status quo bias is bad for a number of reasons. As I'm mentioned above, it stops or slows us down from doing new things that we should be doing.
Status quo bias. There are a lot of bad things about the way things are. Like the way you stand in front of candy bars at the checkout isle
In a nation dealing with a massive obesity problem, is this really a good idea? I think it's a horrible idea, but it's not talked about very much. There are endless news articles about Facebook ads and targeted ads, but it's because those new, not because they are
