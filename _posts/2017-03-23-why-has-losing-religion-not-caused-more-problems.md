title: "Why has the decline in religion not caused more issues"

Why has the decline in religion not caused more issues. Religion is used to judge the size in ancient civilizations, assuming that to be a certain size they must have had a religion. It is believe to be essential when wondering tribes formed larger groups, when people needed to interact with strangers in a daily basis. 
At one point we developed a new way for learning truth - the scientific method. It had many benefits. But when it was applied to religion, religion failed. So why didn't they cause an increase in immorality? 

The biggest impact of this has probably been declining birth rates, which is a think that bothers economists but it's the advertised benefit of religion.
