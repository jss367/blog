title: "Who are these people?"
---


Amazon has a question-and-answer section of their pages and I usually find it quite helpful. But, every once in a while, I read a review that leaves me stunned and intensely curious. I'll read an answer to a question that goes something like "I don't know. I've never tried/done that". Who are these people? What makes them tick? Do they feel obligated to post online? Is there some Amazon award for answering questions? Or Is this a new version of talking because you like the sound of your own voice? Or is there some technical issue, like they don't realize the context or something? Or did Amazon scrape that answer from some forum where you could ask direct questions and it made more sense to respond with "I don't know" in that context?

Edit: I found the answer, it was a technical misunderstanding. Someone on Reddit posted an answer that sounds right. Just in case it's deleted, they said, "This is an error in blame of Amazon's requests for people to answer questions about products that were purchased. People buy things and then get emails under the impression that a user is specifically asking them a question. So they respond as if it was a private message. I've made this mistake too. Of course I remedied it when I saw it was a public answer."
