One thing I did not initially appreciate about Australia was the amazing number and diversity of its avian population. There are more birds in New South Wales than there are in all of England. And they don't just keep to the tree-filled coasts either; they are by far the dominate class of vertebrates in the Red Centre. I have recorded over 100 species of birds in the area around Alice Springs, far exceeding the four native mammals (red kangaroo, common wallaroo, rock wallaby, and dingos) and maybe dozen or so reptiles that I have seen. This incredible speciation has produced interesting differences in the birdlife, especially in the beak. <!--more-->


The thing that makes beaks so interesting to me is how much of the bird's lifestyle is revealed through the beak. It's like a description of the history that of that species, carved right into its facial features. Some beaks, like of this zebra finch, are short and thick. This makes them specially designed for cracking seeds open.

Other beaks are best for shredding flesh, like this wedge-tailed eagle. The wedge-tailed eagle is the largest bird of prey in Australia. They usually hunt smaller animals like rabbits and other birds, but they can even take down an adult kangaroo during difficult times. These beaks are strong and hooked at the end. This shape of beak is optimal for killing prey and tearing it apart.

The hooked beak is a fundamental feature of raptors. Falcons, like this brown falcon, evolved independently from eagles. Although the eagle is closely related to many other raptors, such as buzzards, hawks, and kites, it is not closely related to the falcon. However, falcons have evolved a similar hooked beak for tearing meat. The process where two non-related animals develop to fill a similar niche (predatory bird) and develop similar features (hooked beak) is known as convergent evolution.

Parrots have strong and versatile beaks. They are excellent at eating fruit, but they are also capable of cracking kernels and drinking nectar. Parrots evolved in the part of Gondwana that is now Australia, so they are intimately tied to this land. They have shaped both the surrounding flora and fauna in many ways. They enjoy sweet foods, like fruit and nectar. The nectar eating is a bit complicated, because as you can see they don’t have the beak shape we typically see with nectar-eating birds like hummingbirds and sunbirds. But the beaks are strong and the parrots will tear into the flowers looking for nectar. This is opposite of what the flowers had in mind. Flowers evolved nectar as an incentive to get bees and birds to visit their flowers to spread their pollen. But if a parrot rips into a flower and destroys it, this defeats the purpose. Thus flowers in Australia have evolved to be more generous with their nectar dispensing, allowing birds without specially designed beaks to enjoy the nectar as well.

Nectar is a very important source of food for many birds, including this yellow-throated miner that stops for food at this grevillea in the front yard. The beak is designed for nectar, but not to the degree of some of the finches that Darwin was studying or the hummingbirds of North America. This less-specialized beak allows the miner to eat insects as well as nectar.

Many birds feed primarily on insects, and their beaks vary by how exactly they find them. Mostly the beaks of insectivorous birds are long and thin, like this black-faced woodswallow:

Other beaks are larger and thicker, specially made for consuming lizards. Australia has more species of kingfisher, including the famous kookaburras, than anywhere else in the world. Kingfishers, like this red-backed kingfisher, are better for eating fish, small crustaceans, small rodents, and lizards. The seafood delicacies are hard to come by in The Outback, so they mostly rely on reptiles for food.

Then there’s the generalist beaks. These beaks are strong enough to eat seeds and nuts, but allow the bird to pick up insects. This magpie-lark likes to walk around the backyard, inspecting the fence and back of the house for insects.
