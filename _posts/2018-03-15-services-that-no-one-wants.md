The other thing is social networks that don't rely on advertisements.

There are tons of these. Ello is the probably the most popular one. It's in the category of once every couple years you have to Google it to see if it's finally dead or not. TechCrunch even had an article that starts with "Remember Ello? It would like you to know it is not dead." That's the level of success we're talking about here.
Ello is ad-free.



I get pitched on these all the time, only for people to look at my, shocked, when I tell them the exact

(Sidenote: if you're going to pitch an idea to anyone, it looks really bad if the exact thing exists and you haven't put in enough time to be aware of it.)

Dispora is another one. It's a nonprofit where the users own the site. The nodes are distributed amongst the users, so it can't ever be controled by one entity. It launched with a bunch of fanfare but then within a year had mostly disappeared.

Vero doesn't do any ads or targeting or data mining. Their plan is, as far as I know, to start charging subscriptions at some point. I'll admit I haven't followed it closely but from what I've read it still seems free to use, probably because they know the minute they start charging a subscription everyone will leave. People just want to *talk* about having a subscription model instead of an ad-based one, but they don't actually want it.
My guess is they just lose money each year. They're founded by a billionaire, so it might be able to continue for a while, but I doubt it'll turn into a profitable company.



Minds is another one - free, open source, distributed. 


Update: Jimmy Wales, founder of Wikipedia, has created another one called "WT Social". It includes paid membership. I'm not holding my breath...

Cocoon - going to be a paid subsciption


A lot of this is network effects. The encumbent has a huge advantage. But that's not the only story or we'd still all be on Friendster or MySpace.
