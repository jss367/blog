Are all cultures equal? If so, what about the numemberg trials, which essentially decided that there are so intrinsically terrible that they run counter to being a human being. A culture that doesn't do this is superior to one that does. Evil is universal among humans. Maybe God is less clear. But we can start at stopping evil. Perhaps that's all we need


I don't think so and I think this has important implications for today's world.
