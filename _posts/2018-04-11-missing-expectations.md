title: "What Is Different Than You Would Expect"
---

I think it's a worthwhile exercise to try to consider what, given what you know about the world, you expect.

Like, if you didn't knew everything you know about the world today except the state of the space program, what would you expect it to be? Would you expect humans to have landed on the Moon and then within a decade lost interest and 50 years later not have the technology to do it anymore?



If you told me I ate chicken every day, but I never run into a living chicken, I would be really surprised. Even when I drive out into the country, I almost never see chickens. 

I eat a lot of free-range chicken and eggs. Where are those chickens?


Things that would be different than I expect
More cemeteries, more knowledge of family history
Where are all the chickens?
