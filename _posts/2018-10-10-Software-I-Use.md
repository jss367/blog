I'm always curious how people set up their computers and what software packages they have, so I thought I would share mine. I use Windows, Mac, and Linux, so the exact setup varies.


# General

## Notetaking
Sublime Text
- with package control
- absolutely love this. Use it every day

Notepad ++
- honorable mention but almost completely replaced by Sublime Text

Evernote
- really good but I just don't use it that much anymore

## Utilities

### Searching for files
Agent ransack
- Perfect search tool. I strongly favor this over the (otherwise also very good) alternatives
- Windows only, unfortunately

### Unzipping
7-Zip
- clear winner for Windows

### Checking disk space
windirstat

# Programming

## Python distribution

Anaconda
- now a no-brainer for data scientists

## IDE
VSCode 
- Right now it's VSCode and I'm very happy with it. I have used many of the alternatives and in general I think there are a lot of good options, but I really like VSCode.

We all know extensions are a lot of the reason that VSCode is so great. Some of the ones I use are:
* autoDocstring
* Better Comments
* Code Runner
* Docker
* GitLens - Git supercharged
* Material Icon Theme
* Python
* Remote - WSL (Windows only)
* Remote - SSH
* Remote - Containers
* Settings Sync
* Visual Studio IntelliCode



And, of course, configuring your IDE that way you like it is essential, and VSCode is incredibly extensible. First, here's how to access the settings:

* Open the Command Palette: `CMD/CTRL + SHIFT + P`
* You can use either the User Interface (`Preferences: Open Settings (UI)`) or edit the json directly `Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)`. 

You can also jump to the settings or Command Palette by clicking on the settings wheel in the bottom left corner.

Here are the configurations I use:
```
{
    "editor.rulers": [80, 120],
    "python.linting.flake8Enabled": true,
    "python.linting.enabled": true,
    "python.formatting.autopep8Args":["--aggressive", "--aggressive", "--max-line-length", "120", "--ignore", "E26"],
}
```

R and Rstudio

# Web browsers
I always have three or more web browsers on each computer. I use them for different things. All are very good.
* Google Chrome
* Mozille Firefox
* Brave



# Music
Spotify
- seems to have won the market for now

# Cloud Storage

* Google backup and sync
* Dropbox
* Microsoft Onedrive
* Pcloud drive

Yes, I do use four different cloud services. All for slightly different purposes.

# Terminals

In Windows I use a mix, mostly because none of them are perfect. Here's a case (unlike browsers) that I would rather just have one

* cmder
** Allows *nix style commands, makes switching between Mac and Linux and Windows much easier
* ConEmu
** Top contender for best terminal
* Windows PowerShell
* Anaconda Prompt - for Anaconda stuff only
* WSL 2
* ubuntu

terminal

I have to say I like the terminal game in Mac better. For me, nothing beats iTerm2


# Malware protection

I have no loyalty to any of these. I usually just go with the top free one recommended. I've also used paid ones in the past but I don't know if it's worth it.

malware bytes
avast

# Office Suite
libreoffice
- I actually don't use this very much anymore. For work I usually stick to Google's online offerings

# Other

clover - this is really helpful but it's sketchy. It always alerts my antivirus software so I don't recommend it. I'm looking for an alternative


google earth

windscribe

autowrite thing

auto hotkey

Speccy
- Windows only

git
github

texmaker and pdflatex (through miktex)

astronomy picture of the dayz


inkscape
keepass - dashlane, although far from perfect


docker
- Still a pain on Windows. Wonderful for linux and Mac

wget for windows - 
https://eternallybored.org/misc/wget/
- just stick in somewhere in your path, C:\Windows


sumatra (pdf) - or just my web browser now

patch my pc
- I'm still looking for something to help me automatically update software on my computer. So far I've gone with patch my pc but there's nothing I like

texmaker - but NEED A DISTRIBUTION WITH IT - MIKTEX
hxd (hex editor)
