title: "Software I Use"
tags: [Software]
---

I'm always curious about how people set up their computers and what software packages they have, so I thought I would share mine. I use Windows, Mac, and Linux, so the exact setup varies. For those of you on Windows, many of these can be installed with [Ninite](https://ninite.com/).

# General

## Text Editors
[Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
* I absolutely love this. Use it every day
* With package control
* Be sure to include the [Markdown Editor](https://github.com/SublimeText-Markdown/MarkdownEditing)

[Notepad ++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) (Ninite)
* Honorable mention but almost completely replaced by Sublime Text

[Evernote](https://evernote.com/) (Ninite)
* Really good but I just don't use it that much anymore
* Good for long-term memory stuff, receipts

[Atom](https://atom.io/)
* I've used this but prefer the others, so rarely go back to it

Note that you can also use a full IDE as a text editor. Only makes sense if you're already using one though.

#### Editting Markdown

[Zettlr](https://www.zettlr.com/)
* I've recently started using this and like it so far.
* I don't like how it defaults to asking you to name a file for a new file but you can turn that off in the preferences

[Mark Text]([https://marktext.app/](https://marktext.app/))
* Here's the other one I use a lot. I recommend them both, about equally.

## Utilities

### File Management

[Commander One](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/commander-one-file-manager/id1035236694?mt=12) (Mac only)
* *Much* better than Finder

[muCommander](https://www.mucommander.com/)
* More lightweight than Commander One, so I'm starting to prefer it
* [This website](https://logicgrimoire.wordpress.com/2013/11/15/richs-quick-and-easy-guide-to-file-management-with-mucommander/) offers good tips on how to get started with it

Still looking for one on Windows that I like

### Searching for files
[Agent Ransack](https://www.mythicsoft.com/agentransack/) (Windows only)
- Perfect search tool. I strongly favor this over the (otherwise also very good) alternatives
- No equivalent for Linux or Mac, although there are decent built-in options

### Unzipping
[7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html) (Ninite)
- The clear winner for Windows

### Checking disk space
[WinDirStat](https://windirstat.net/index.html) (Windows only) (Ninite)

[ncdu](https://dev.yorhel.nl/ncdu)

## Web Browsers
I always have three or more web browsers on each computer. I use them for different things. All are very good.
* [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) (Ninite)
* [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) (Ninite)
* [Brave](https://brave.com/)

### Brower Extensions
* AdBlockPlus
* BitWarden

## Media
[Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/us/) (Ninite)
* Seems to have won the music player market for now

[VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html) (FOSS, Ninite)

[Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) (FOSS, Ninite)


## Cloud Storage

[Google backup and sync](https://www.google.com/drive/download/backup-and-sync/) (Ninite)
* Unlimited photos, very good app
* They keep renaming it, and I expect that to continue. It's Google

[Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/) (Ninite)
* Poor website interface but other than that one of my favorites

[Microsoft OneDrive](https://products.office.com/en-us/onedrive/online-cloud-storage) (Ninite)
* This does syncing very well

[Pcloud Drive](https://www.pcloud.com/download-free-online-cloud-file-storage.html)
* Not as good as the others but I still use it every day

Yes, I do use four different cloud services (actually more, but these are the ones I recommend). All for slightly different purposes.

## Productivity

[Moom](https://manytricks.com/moom/) (Mac only)
* Amazing app for resizing windows. One of my favorite Mac apps

[Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) (Mac only)
* In the running for one of the best productivity apps in existence
* Can be as simple or complex as you like
* Recommend to everyone

[Todoist](https://todoist.com/)

[Karabiner-Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/) (FOSS, Mac only)
* Great for remapping keys
* You can [add the best Windows shortcuts to Mac](https://ke-complex-modifications.pqrs.org/?q=windows) with it

# Programming

## Python distribution

[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) (FOSS)
* Now a no-brainer for data scientists

## IDE
[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (Ninite)
* Right now it's VSCode and I'm very happy with it. I have used many of the alternatives and, in general, I think there are a lot of good options, but I like VSCode.
* Configuring your IDE that way you like it is essential, and VSCode is incredibly extensible.

[PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
* Honorable mention
* I used to use this but since VSCode has improved its remote support so much I haven't gone back
* It is excellent though and I recommend it

[RStudio](https://rstudio.com/)
* The clear winner in my opinion for R IDE, although I don't use R much anymore

## Version Control
[Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* I think git has by-and-large won the version control market
* Used in partnership with [Github](https://github.com/)
* Git is great but frustrating when you [can't figure it out](https://xkcd.com/1597/) (yes, I've done this)
* Github is amazing and makes git much more beginner-friendly
* * I also recommend the [GitHub CLI](https://github.com/cli/cli)

# Terminals

## Mac

[iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/)
* The clear winner for Mac and my overall favorite. I wish Linux and Windows had this

## Windows

In Windows, I use a mix, mostly because none of them are perfect. Here's a case (unlike browsers) that I would rather just have one

[Cmder](https://cmder.net/)
* Allows Unix style commands, makes switching between Mac and Linux and Windows much easier

[ConEmu](https://conemu.github.io/)
* A top contender for the best terminal in Windows. This is a really good terminal

[Windows PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/getting-started/getting-started-with-windows-powershell?view=powershell-7)
* Sometimes I like it and sometimes I don't...

[Anaconda Prompt](https://www.anaconda.com/)
* I only use this for Anaconda stuff

[Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL 2)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/wsl2-install)
* Promising, definite promising. Keep working on it Microsoft!

[Ubuntu terminal](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/tutorial-ubuntu-on-windows#1-overview)
* Still a work in progress. Gets better all the time but still has room for improvement.

As you can see, I'm strewn across half a dozen terminals in Windows and have found the one on Mac. For me, nothing beats iTerm2.

## Linux
[Terminator](https://gnometerminator.blogspot.com/p/introduction.html)
* Favorite for Linux at the moment

# Shells
[Zsh](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/)
* Default on Mac now
* Manage it with [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)
* You can also [install it on Windows](https://winsmarts.com/running-oh-my-zsh-on-windows-10-6fcb0fbc736b)
* Overall, I like it. Easy to customize

Example zsh prompt:
```
parse_git_branch() {
     git branch 2> /dev/null | sed -e '/^[^*]/d' -e 's/* \(.*\)/(\1)/'
}
# customize the zsh prompt
PS1='%B%F{green}%(?.%F{green}âˆš.%F{red}X:%?) %B%F{251} %1~ $(parse_git_branch)\ %# '
```

# Office Suite
[Google Docs](https://www.google.com/docs/about/)
* Don't love it, but great for sharing and multi-person editing

[Google Slides](https://www.google.com/slides/about/)
* I prefer Excel, but it's free and I don't use spreadsheets enough to buy Excel

[LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) (FOSS, Ninite)
* I prefer this to Google's offerings but I don't use this very much anymore.

# Security

## Malware protection

I have no loyalty to any of these. I usually just go with the top free one recommended. I've also used paid ones in the past but I don't know if it's worth it.

[Malware Bytes](https://www.malwarebytes.com/) (Ninite)

[Avast](https://www.avast.com/en-us/index#pc) (Ninite)
* The free version has so many obnoxious popups it's basically adware. So you install adware to avoid malware, most of which is adware... I guess I'm supposed to buy the paid version. It's hard to know how good your anti-virus software is.

## VPN

[Windscribe](https://windscribe.com/)
* I do not have a favorite VPN and I've tried many, both paid and free. Right now I'm using this. It's... OK

Mozilla also released one that I've started using a bit

## Password Managers

[Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/)
* I feel like I've finally found the password manager that I've been looking for. Does what I want without being obnoxious

Honorable mentions:
* [KeePass 2](https://keepass.info/) (FOSS, Ninite)
* [Dashlane](https://www.dashlane.com/) (paid) - Lots of features but can be very annoying. Not good at interpreting input fields

## Managing Updates

[Patch My PC](https://patchmypc.com/home-updater-download) (Windows only)
* I'm still looking for something to help me automatically update software on my computer. So far I've gone with patch my pc but there's nothing I like


## Messaging

[Discord](https://discordapp.com/) (Ninite)

[Slack](https://slack.com/)
* I can't believe this took so long to be invented. This is how communication should be

# Databases
    
[Azure Data Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/azure-data-studio/download-azure-data-studio?view=sql-server-ver15)
* Free and looks like VSCode

[Postico](https://eggerapps.at/postico/) (Mac only)
* Not free but still very good

[Navicat](https://www.navicat.com/en/)
* Still deciding if I like this
* Not free

# LaTeX Editor

[Texmaker](https://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/)
* Requires a distribution with it. I like MIKTEX
* I also recommend pdflatex (through miktex)

# Hex editor
* [HxD](https://mh-nexus.de/en/hxd/) (Windows only)

* For Mac I'm trying out [Hex Fiend](https://ridiculousfish.com/hexfiend/)


# Video conferencing

[Zoom](https://zoom.us/) (Ninite)

[Google Hangouts](https://hangouts.google.com/)

# Photography

[Adobe Lightroom](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom.html)
* As much as I'd like to say [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/ ) is just as good, it's no match for the features of Lightroom. For someone who spends serious time editing photos, I don't think there's a better alternative.

[Image Composite Editor](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/image-composite-editor/)
* Free tool from Microsoft to stitch images for panoramas. Works better than Lightroom

[StarStaX](https://markus-enzweiler.de/software/starstax/)
* Great for making star trails
* A really nice simple piece of software that does one thing well

[ISS Transit Finder](https://transit-finder.com/)
* Online only, no download

# Other

[Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/)
* Pretty good. I hope it keeps getting better as natural language processing improves

[Google Earth](https://www.google.com/earth/) (Ninite)

[AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/)

[Speccy](https://www.ccleaner.com/speccy) (Windows only)

[Astronomy Picture of the Day](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/astronomy-picture-of-the-day/9wzdncrfj1xh?activetab=pivot:overviewtab)
* Get beautiful backgrounds every day

[Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) (FOSS, Ninite)

[Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
* Still a pain on Windows Home. Wonderful for Linux and Mac

[Wget for Windows](https://eternallybored.org/misc/wget/)
* just stick in somewhere in your path, C:\Windows

[Sumatra PDF](https://www.sumatrapdfreader.org/free-pdf-reader.html) (Ninite)
* For reading pdfs
* I mainly just my web browser now

[Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/) (FOSS)
* The clear winner for free network protocol analyzers

[Papertrail](https://www.papertrail.com/)
* Cloud-hosted logging

## Research

[Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/download-desktop-new/)
* The best app for keeping track of scientific papers
* Definitely use the browser extensions as well


## Evaluating:

[GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/)
* Seems good so far, although the free version doesn't work for private repos.

[CyberDuck](https://cyberduck.io/)

[HyperSwitch](https://bahoom.com/hyperswitch)
