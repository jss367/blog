I'm always curious how people set up their computers and what software packages they have, so I thought I would share mine. I use Windows, Mac, and Linux, so the exact setup varies. Many of these can be installed with [Ninite](https://ninite.com/).


# General

## Notetaking
[Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
** with package control
** absolutely love this. Use it every day

[Notepad ++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) (Ninite)
** honorable mention but almost completely replaced by Sublime Text

[Evernote](https://evernote.com/)
* really good but I just don't use it that much anymore

[Atom](https://atom.io/)
* I've used this but not strongly prefer Sublime Text, so almost never go back to it

## Utilities

### Searching for files
[Agent Ransack](https://www.mythicsoft.com/agentransack/)
- Perfect search tool. I strongly favor this over the (otherwise also very good) alternatives
- Windows only, unfortunately

### Unzipping
[7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html)
- clear winner for Windows

### Checking disk space
[WinDirStat](https://windirstat.net/index.html) (Windows only)

# Programming

## Python distribution

[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)
- now a no-brainer for data scientists

## IDE
[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Right now it's VSCode and I'm very happy with it. I have used many of the alternatives and in general I think there are a lot of good options, but I really like VSCode.

And, of course, configuring your IDE that way you like it is essential, and VSCode is incredibly extensible. First, here's how to access the settings:

* Open the Command Palette: `CMD/CTRL + SHIFT + P`
* You can use either the User Interface (`Preferences: Open Settings (UI)`) or edit the json directly `Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)`. 

You can also jump to the settings or Command Palette by clicking on the settings wheel in the bottom left corner.

You can see (and copy) all the extensions and settings I use in my [Visual Studio Code Settings Sync Gist](https://gist.github.com/jss367/6574f6940f7c9603ffd949f42ca4f205)

* R 
* Rstudio
** Clear winner in my opinion for R IDE, although I don't use R much anymore

## Version Control
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Github](https://github.com/)



# Web browsers
I always have three or more web browsers on each computer. I use them for different things. All are very good.
* [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) (Ninite)
* Mozille Firefox (Ninite)
* [Brave](https://brave.com/)

# Music
[Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/us/)
- seems to have won the market for now

# Cloud Storage

* Google backup and sync
* [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/)
* [Microsoft OneDrive](https://products.office.com/en-us/onedrive/online-cloud-storage)
* [Pcloud Drive](https://www.pcloud.com/download-free-online-cloud-file-storage.html)

Yes, I do use four different cloud services. All for slightly different purposes.

# Terminals

In Windows I use a mix, mostly because none of them are perfect. Here's a case (unlike browsers) that I would rather just have one


* cmder
** Allows Unix style commands, makes switching between Mac and Linux and Windows much easier
* ConEmu
** Top contender for best terminal
* Windows PowerShell
* Anaconda Prompt - for Anaconda stuff only
* WSL 2
* ubuntu terminal
** Still a work in progress. (Currently not working for me)

I have to say I like the terminal game in Mac better. For me, nothing beats iTerm2

# Office Suite
* [Google Docs](https://www.google.com/docs/about/)
* [Google Slides](https://www.google.com/slides/about/)
* [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) (Ninite)
** I actually don't use this very much anymore. For work I usually stick to Google's online offerings


# Security

## Malware protection

I have no loyalty to any of these. I usually just go with the top free one recommended. I've also used paid ones in the past but I don't know if it's worth it.

* Malware Bytes
* Avast

## VPN

I do not have a favorite VPN and I've tried many, both paid and free. Right now I'm using [Windscribe](https://windscribe.com/). It's... OK

## Password Managers

Still haven't found the perfect one. The two I've used most recently are:

* [Keepass](https://keepass.info/) (FOSS)
* [Dashlane](https://www.dashlane.com/) (paid)

## Managing Updates

* [Patch My PC](https://patchmypc.com/home-updater-download) (Windows only)
** I'm still looking for something to help me automatically update software on my computer. So far I've gone with patch my pc but there's nothing I like


# Other

* Clover
** this is really helpful but it's sketchy. It always alerts my antivirus software so I don't recommend it. I'm looking for an alternative


* [Google Earth](https://www.google.com/earth/)

* Auto hotkey

* [Speccy](https://www.ccleaner.com/speccy) (Windows only)

* vlc
* adobe lightroom
* image composite editor

* texmaker and pdflatex (through miktex)

* astronomy picture of the dayz

* inkscape (FOSS, Ninite)

* Docker
** Still a pain on Windows Basic. Wonderful for linux and Mac

* [wget for windows](https://eternallybored.org/misc/wget/)
** just stick in somewhere in your path, C:\Windows


* sumatra (pdf) - or just my web browser now

* Wireshark

## Latex Editor

* texmaker
** Requires a distribution with it. I like MIKTEX

## Hex editor
* [HxD](https://mh-nexus.de/en/hxd/)
