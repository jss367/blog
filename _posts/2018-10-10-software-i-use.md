I'm always curious how people set up their computers and what software packages they have, so I thought I would share mine. I use Windows, Mac, and Linux, so the exact setup varies.


# General

## Notetaking
Sublime Text
- with package control
- absolutely love this. Use it every day

notepad ++
- honorable mention but almost completely replaced by Sublime Text

## Utilities

### Searching for files
Agent ransack
- Perfect search tool. I strongly favor this over the (otherwise also very good) alternatives
- Windows only, unfortunately

### Unzipping
7-zip
- clear winner for Windows

### Checking disk space
windirstat

# Programming

## Python distribution

Anaconda
- now a no-brainer for data scientists

## IDE
VSCode 
- Right now it's VSCode and I'm very happy with it. I have used many of the alternatives and in general I think there are a lot of good options, but I really like VSCode.

R and Rstudio


vlc
adobe lightroom
image composite editor

(from ninite)

# Web browsers
I always have three or more web browsers on each computer. I use them for different things. All are very good.
* Google Chrome
* Mozille Firefox
* Brave



# Music
Spotify
- seems to have won the market for now

# Cloud Storage

google backup and sync

dropbox

onedrive

pcloud drive

Yes, I do use four different cloud services. All for slightly different purposes.

# Terminals

In Windows I use a mix, mostly because none of them are perfect. Here's a case (unlike browsers) that I would rather just have one

ConEmu
Windows PowerShell
Anaconda Prompt - for Anaconda stuff only
WSL 2
ubuntu
cmder
terminal

I have to say I like the terminal game in Mac better. For me, nothing beats iTerm2


# Malware protection

I have no loyalty to any of these. I usually just go with the top free one recommended. I've also used paid ones in the past but I don't know if it's worth it.

malware bytes
avast

# Other

clover - this is really helpful but it's sketchy. It always alerts my antivirus software so I don't recommend it. I'm looking for an alternative


libreoffice
google earth

evernote

windscribe

autowrite thing

auto hotkey

Speccy
- Windows only

git
github

texmaker and pdflatex (through miktex)

astronomy picture of the dayz


inkscape
keepass - dashlane, although far from perfect


docker

wget for windows - 
https://eternallybored.org/misc/wget/
- just stick in somewhere in your path, C:\Windows


sumatra (pdf) - or just my web browser now


patch my pc

texmaker - but NEED A DISTRIBUTION WITH IT - MIKTEX
hxd (hex editor)
