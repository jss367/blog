title: "Why Is New Architecture so Lame"
---

I went to Munich recently. One of the most impressive sights was the Neues Rathaus inside Marienplatz. It contains the Rathaus-Glockspiel, and I was there at the right time to see the display. But what struck me was, why is the most interesting, most beautiful, architecture, also the oldest? This isn't just true of Munich, this is true of almost anywhere. It seems like we're done building incredible architecture, at least for now.

There are some things, like the Sydney Opera House, that are beautiful and somewhat recent. But, in general, when I travel around somewhere to look at beautiful architecture, it's the old buildings that I'm looking at. The new stuff is lame. Are we done making beautiful things? Aren't we richer now? Aren't we supposed to know a whole bunch of things that we didn't know before? Why did we give up? Is it a change in priorities?
