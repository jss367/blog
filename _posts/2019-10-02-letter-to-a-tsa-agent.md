title: "Letter to a TSA Agent"

I remember the look in your eye when you told me I couldn't have my peanut butter back. We went back and forth about what was allowed and constituted as "spreadable" and whether there were different policies for chunky and smooth. But we both know what we were really talking about - whether you were actually making America safety, the world a better place. 
Did you know that my wonderful cousin, Annika, had given it to me? Did you care? 

I dare not say it out loud, but I wonder if you reflected on it. I wonder if you wondered, "What am I doing here?" And, most importantly of all "Why?"
