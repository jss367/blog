title: "Will AGI be humanlike"

Being human isn't like reaching a value of 1.0 on the "humanness" scale. It's about being located somewhere within a range in thousands of different scales. The is no way a computer could simultaneously reach all those levels without surprassing some before reaching others. In fact, it already has.

There's a scale of how good something is at multiplication. Monkeys are at the bottom with basically no ability, humans are somewhere above that, and computers far above that. Image another scale, let's say folding laundry. Monkeys are a little better than 0 but probably not much. Computers have recently moved up this scale [^1]. Humans are still much higher. But there are hundreds and thousands of such scales. The only way an AGI could appear human would be by reaching the human level and artificially limiting it, which I don't think is ever going to happen. We will never have human-like AGI, and I think that's a good thing.


There's also a scale of how to play chess. Apparently AlphaZero plays chess is a very non-human way. It has different moves. It is different in ways that we find very creative.
