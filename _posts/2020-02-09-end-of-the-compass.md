excerpt: We have no moral compass for the 21st century
---

The genesis of morality has long been debated, with religious leaders and their followers asserting that it comes from religion, and secularists claiming that it is innate within humans. I'm in the second camp, and I believe that we have evolved our senses of ethics. What's more, I believe other intelligent animals like chimpanzees, bonobos, and dolphins all have highly evolved senses of ethics as well. I don't think there's a way to develop a group with any level of complexity without some sense of ethics. Chimpanzees don't murder whenever they want. There are, however, wars, coups, bully that can lead to death, all within chimpanzees. But this is very different from engading in arbitrary murders. In fact, all of these things happen within humans and we certainly consider humans to have ethics.
