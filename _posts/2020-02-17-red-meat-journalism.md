title:  Red Meat Journalism
---

Yellow journalism as been around for a long time, and, I would wager, probably extends back to some of the first ever writing. I think we're experiencing something different at the moment. I call it "Red Meat Journalism". I see so many articles today that seem like complete pandering to their audiences. If it's on the left, it's something along the lines of the rich and the tech world are doing horrible things to do. If it's on the right, it's something along the lines of "These people in government are trying to pull one over you."

There no expectation, or probably even desire from the readers, to delve deeply into the topic. Just passing reference that "Mexico is taking our jobs away" is enough. They don't delve into what it means to take a job away, how we know this, how the situation has changed over time. They don't even feel the need to convince anyone - that's why it's Read Meat Journalism - they're just throwing red meat out to an incredibly receptive audience.
