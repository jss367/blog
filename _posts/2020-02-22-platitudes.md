title:  Why Are Platitudes so Wrong?
---


Whenever I hear a platitudes, I'm often stuck by one question: How is it so wrong? Platitudes often seem somewhere between terrible advice and completely wrong. Like the notion of "opposites attract". This seems clearly incorrect to me and so much so that I don't understand how anyone could actually believe it is true in some general way.

This idea is so counter to my experiences yet it's the title for a book on personality: https://www.amazon.com/Opposites-Attract-Secrets-Personality-Create/dp/0061914290, https://www.amazon.com/Love-You-but-Why-Different/dp/0736908277 It's funny because a 2013 meta analysis of 240 studies found that, to what should be absolutely no one's surprise, that opposites do not attract [^1].

Perhaps this particular started because differences between people stand out more than similarities. However, I think there are aspects of platitudes in general that cause them to spread. I think there's something about the unintuitive nature of them that makes them easy to remember and fun to repeat. And why are they unintuitive? Probably because so many of them are dead wrong, that would certainly make them unintuitive. They also have a semblance of truth, especially if you don't think about them. That's what makes them acceptable, but I think it's their unintuitive nature that makes them viral.

I guess there's a couple reasons, there's nothing like a sample size of one to convince some people that they have found a fundamental law of the universe. Second, a well-known bias is that they actively go out and look for confirmation (known as confimation bias).


"Don’t assume – it makes an ASS out of U and ME." I don't think 
For example, because our emails were in English and we're in Virginia, I assumed the interview would be in English. That's a pretty good assumption. I really don't think the people who say this show up everywhere they do with a backpack full of translation disctionaries (and their own oxygen tank).

"Love means never having to say you’re sorry." - What? Have you been in a relationship?


And, remember, "Age is just a number" so "Live each moment like it's your last".
