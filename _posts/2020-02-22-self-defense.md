Self-defense


It is generally considered, in the weird way that humans distinguish between murder killing and non-murder killing, to be acceptable to kill in self-defense. That is, if your life is in danger, it is acceptable to kill to save yourself.

I think there's a hidden assumption here. The assumption is that the person you are killing is the one putting your life in danger. But what if that's not the case? What in the case when the person you must kill to save your life is an innocent bystander? Think it's a far-fetched notion? Perhaps, in regular times. But take a look at this except from a Gernman soldier in World War I:


French shells began to hit to the right and left of us, leaving human forms writhing in agony. Our advance came to a stop and after hesitating a few minutes we drew back while the artillery fire followed us, ripping large gashes in our formation - soon the French drumfire engulfed us, the air was filled with gas and flying pieces of steel.

We automatically mounted the machine gun for action. Then like animals, we burrowed into the earth as if trying to find protection deep in its bosom. Something struck my back where I carried my gas mask, but I did not pay attention to it. A steel splinter broke the handle of my spade and another knocked the remains out of my hand. I kept digging with my bare hands, ducking my head every time a shell exploded nearby.

A boy to my side was hit in the arm and cried out for help. I crawled over to him, ripped the sleeves of his coat and shirt open and started to bind the bleeding part. The gas was so thick now I could hardly discern what I was doing. My eyes began to water and I felt as if I would choke. I reached for my gas mask, pulled it out of its container - then noticed to my horror that a splinter had gone through it leaving a large hole.

I had seen death thousands of times, stared it in the face, but never experienced the fear I felt then. Immediately I reverted to the primitive. I felt like an animal cornered by hunters. With the instinct of self-preservation uppermost, my eyes fell on the boy whose arm I had bandaged. Somehow he had managed to put the gas mask on his face with his one good arm. I leapt at him and in the next moment had ripped the gas mask from his face. With a feeble gesture he tried to wrench it from my grasp; then fell back exhausted. {% include pullquote.html quote="The last thing I saw before putting on the mask were his pleading eyes." %}

Is that self-defense?
