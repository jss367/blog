Stop Aggregating Statistics

The mean is not what you mean

Do you like your office?


if you have a question like, do you like your office and you have ppl in 10 diff offices...don't combine them. there's a false assumption that the mean is representative of the data. sometimes it is, sometimes it's not


The mean is not useful.




Scores on intro computer science classes... The kids who know it and the kids who don't.


There's an implicit statement being made when you show someone the mean value. You imply that that value is representative of the overlaying data. But it's not always.

Image looking at life expectancy. You see it going up and up over time, and you naturally assume that means that people are living longer. Well, that could be the case. But sometimes this just reflects lower infant mortality rates. So, yes, the average life expectancy is increasing, but it's a far more accurate story to show that infant mortality rates are declining and the life expectancy of an adult remains the same.
