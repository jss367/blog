title: "Why Can't I Use My Brain to Learn How Brains Work"
---

It's remarkable how much you can with a brain without know how it works. When I recall a memory, where do I retrieve it from? Is it all stored in one place in my brain? Is it scattered? If I retrieve it a second time, is it the same as the first time? What happens each time when I stop thinking of it? I imagine it's automatically stored somewhere. Is it compressed each time? Is it lossy compression or lossless? I imagine it's lossy. Is it the type of compression that loses information each compression, or does it just lose information upon compression the first time, and each subsequent just uncompress and recompress the same information without additional loss? Does it get worse each time you recall and they reencode it? Or does it get worse over time? Can't I prevent that from happening? Why can't I seem to delete memories? Why can't I tell it which memories are important, and make sure it doesn't compress those ones too much?

When I can't think of something, where is it? And when it comes back, how did that happen? 

I have found the answers to many (though not all) of these, but I find it remarkable that despite HAVING an actual brain, I can't get a single hint of these answers out of it. I can't figure out how it stores information, and how that information is compressed. When I remember something or think something, it just happens. I see to have no control over it.
