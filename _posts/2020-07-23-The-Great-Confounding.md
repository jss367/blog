The Great Confounding

How, after a major financial crisis, did immigration and stealing jobs become the big issue?

Something has been confusing me for quite a while. The Great Recession brought about a lot of economic stress on Americans. It's understandable that lots of people would be upset by it and only human nature that they would would for someone to blame. And general, the blame seems to lie with Wall Street. I know, this isn't a particularly well-defined term, but stay with me a moment. It's not the specific details of the term that matters here (was it the people designing the credit default swaps or the rating agencies or ...). None of the matters here.

OK, so the blame lies with "Wall Street", but I have been astounded at how anti-immigration sentiment has risen. I mean, some of this is human nature, but the fault in the economy is so clearly with those on Wall Street, how can people be mad at immigrants? It's been a truly remarkable swap that has happened. It's been layed before me in repeated conversations. People telling me that it's become harder to make ends meet and we need to get tough on immigrants. I just can't understand how the blame was so cleanly deflected away from a clear culprit to an unrelated group. I imagine there are a lot of human-nature aspects here. Wall Street is a complex entity, immigrants are easy to dislike, etc. But that the conversation has moved so completely (in some circles) from regulating those that cause this to stipping immigrants from stealing our jobs. I'm astounded.

I wonder how Al-Qaeda (they did 9/11) and Iraq (they didn't) feel about it.
