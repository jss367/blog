title: "Do lawyers exist to create more lawyers"
---


I was reading a bunch of legalise and I can't possible understand how it got this bad. The entire first page is a bunch of definitions. They're definitions of words that no sane person would argue about, which I guess leaves the arguments to the lawyers. I think they intentionally make it more complex than it needs to be to justify themselves. Layers upon layers of obnoxious complexity.


I have a conspiracy theory I'd like to share. Sometimes I'll see a sign, like a "No Tresspassing" sign, with the word "POSTED" written really big at the top. I think there's an assumption that it must be there for a reason. Maybe that someone, somewhere, claimed a No Tresspassing sign wasn't valid because it wasn't officially "Posted". So then they had to write the word "Posted" on all the signs. So now, to make a sign legally binding, you have to put the work "Posted" on it in big letters. But here's my conspiracy. It's that that never happened. The sign sellers just started doing it, hoping that people would assume it means something. "I have a bunch of signs, but none of them say "Posted". I better get some new signs with the word "Posted" so that they're valid."
