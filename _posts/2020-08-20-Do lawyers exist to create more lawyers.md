title: "Do lawyers exist to create more lawyers"
---


I was reading a bunch of legalise in a contract recently and I was struck by the ridiculousness of it all. The entire first page of the contract is a bunch of definitions of words that no sane person would argue about, which I guess leaves the argumentation to the lawyers. They're making clear I know who "I" am and who the "Company" is. Then they follow with definitions that are more obscure than the original word. I'm curious, has anyone actually disputed these terms? Or has a lawyer managed to convince his lawyers friends that potentially someone *could* dispute these words. So they decided to layer on pages of complex legalese to justify needing one at every company. I think they intentionally make it more complex than it needs to be to justify themselves. Layers upon layers of obnoxious complexity.


I have a conspiracy theory I'd like to share. Sometimes I'll see a sign, like a "No Tresspassing" sign, with the word "POSTED" written really big at the top. I think there's an assumption that it must be there for a reason. Maybe that someone, somewhere, claimed a No Tresspassing sign wasn't valid because it wasn't officially "Posted". So then they had to write the word "Posted" on all the signs. So now, to make a sign legally binding, you have to put the work "Posted" on it in big letters. But here's my conspiracy. It's that *that* never happened. The sign sellers just started writing  "POSTED" on their signs, hoping that people would assume it means something. "I have a bunch of signs, but none of them say "Posted". I better get some new signs with the word "Posted" so that they're valid." As with all good conspiracies, I have put no effort into falsifying it. It's just my little conspiracy.
