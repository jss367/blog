title: "Value and Income"

There exists an uneasy relationship between an individual's value to society and their income. At some level, we all know these are not the same. Teachers have high value and (relatively) lower salary. People working on Wall Street have high salary and (relatively) lower value. That's because salary and value are generated differently. Salary is based on the market, on the supply of labor and the demand for it. But value isn't. It's based on societal feelings towards a position, which is much harder to quantify. Parenting, for example, has high value but comes with no salary?

I think people know this, but they often forget it. For example, I often hear people say that "teachers are underpaid" (and somtimes "teachers are *criminally* underpaid"). Underpaid relative to what? I don't think they're underpaid relative to the market rate, because the wondering thing about supply and demand is that as long as you don't mess with it too much, it gets the pricing about right. So they must be underpaid relative to their value. I'm pretty sure this is what people are saying.

But what does it mean to be underpaid relative to someone's value? There's an implicit assuption here that the 

So the question is, should we try to make these things come more in line? Should we pay parents for parenting? Or should we just accept that they are different, and never will be inline. 


In fact, it seems that the reverse is true, imagine someone way better at lowering recidivism. People wouldn't like that person to make a bunch of money
Should we try to align these? If perfect alignment is impossible, is better alignment better?
