title: "Value and Income"
---

There exists an uneasy relationship between an individual's value to society and their income. At some level, we all know these are not the same. Teachers have high value and (relatively) lower salary. People working on Wall Street have high salary and (relatively) lower value. That's because salary and value are generated differently. Salary is based on the market, on the supply of labor and the demand for it. But value isn't. It's based on societal feelings towards a position, which is much harder to quantify. Parenting, for example, has high value but comes with no salary.

I think people *know* this, but they often forget it. For example, I often hear people say that "teachers are underpaid" (and somtimes "teachers are *criminally* underpaid"). Underpaid relative to what? I don't think they're underpaid relative to the market rate, because the wondering thing about supply and demand is that as long as you don't mess with it too much, it gets the pricing about right. So they must be underpaid relative to their value. I'm pretty sure this is what people are saying.

But what does it mean to be underpaid relative to someone's value? There's an implicit assumption here that a person's income should reflect their value to society. Are we really comfortable making that claim. I think it's quite a claim to make. And if we're not, what do we mean when we say that "teachers are underpaid". Unless there's some criminal cabal or something, they're not underpaid relative to the market. No one is being forced to be a teacher against their will. 

So the question is, should we try to make these things come more in line? Should we try to increase the pay of those society values and decrease the pay of those that it doesn't. This path seems to lead nowhere good, as we will have to agree at some level on the value of each position. The only feasible way to do that would be to declare every position equally valuable and pay everyone the same. Do we really want to do that? I know there are some who do, but I think that's a small minority. I think there's a much larger chunk of people who claim that teachers are undervalued, but I'm not sure what that's relative to.

Should we pay parents for parenting? Everyone agrees that parenting has tremendous value, but it's generally (although not completely) an unpaid position. Or should we just accept that they are different, and never will be inline. If they will never be in line, is moving them closer together a good goal? Is a vague sense of "society roughly values you less than market wages, so we'll try to pay you less" good enough to changes someone's compensation?


There's a second unease. It's much better to get rich selling viagara to wealthy men than it is selling AIDS drugs. But if we could only have one, surely we would choose the second. Or, imagine someone is amazing at lower recidivism rates. I would want them running a prison, and if they became incredibly wealthy that's fine with me. But I think most would would be uncomfortable with this.

Most people would object, and say that they would only get wealthy by *lowering* the rate. Sure, but let's do the thought experiment and say the incentives are aligned to get wealthy only by substantially lower the recidivism rate. How would you feel thing? It seems to me that most people are still uncomfortable with this notion.


Should we try to align these? If perfect alignment is impossible, is better alignment better? 


So, are teachers underpaid? Surely, relative to their value, I guess. But not relative to the market. And we don't want to set the price of wages based on value.
