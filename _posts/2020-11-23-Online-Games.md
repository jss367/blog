title: "Online Games"

One of the funny things about the pandemic is that it's forced many of us to "rediscover" the Internet. I've started playing online games with friends and family this year, even though in many cases those people are far away and I wouldn't have seen them in person otherwise. Many of these sites have been around for a while, but I'm just not discovering them. In case it's any use to anyone else, here are some that I've found:

[Coup](https://coup.thebrown.net/)

[Pictionary](https://sketchful.io/)

[Board games](https://boardgamearena.com/gamelist)

[Catan](https://colonist.io/)

[Secret Hitler](https://secrethitler.io/)

[Town of Salem](https://www.blankmediagames.com/)

[Scattergories](https://categories-with-friends.herokuapp.com/)

[Codenames](https://www.horsepaste.com/)
