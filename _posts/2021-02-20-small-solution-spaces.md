A Most Unexplored Solution Space



I find it remarkable how little thought is given to 



There are so many ways we could govern outselves 



States were supposed to be "laboritories for democracy". But these laboratories are doing very little research. There are some positive signs - Maine doing rank-choice voting for example. But we are still 


There are just ways of governing ourselves that we don't even consider. 

Is it necessarily true that the individual who wins a popularity contest should be the president (or even that that much - or that little - power be invested in a person).


One of my hopes in the in the next millenium we put more thought into how we want to do this.





Another hugely important thing is media. Again, we haven't thought much about that. We've just let the capitalism model take over the space much like everything else. But is it like everything else? I'm not convinced that it is.

Are there regulations we could add to it that would improve it? I think so. Let's think big here. I often find retractions disappointing and inadequate. Headlines news story could be completely wrong and, maybe, if you're lucky, a week later you might find a small retraction buried in the depths of the paper.

Fox News spent months on this Seth Rich story. The story was obviously nonsense. This was no "mistake", or slight confusion. They deliberately pushed a false story, knowing that eventually they'll probably have to issue some type of retraction at one point. Does this have to be? I don't think so. This is a case where they were DELIBERATING PUSHING a story which had no basis in fact for ideological reasons. 


Does everything have a right to free speech? I thought that just applied to humans. Do anonymous humans have the same rights as named ones? I think probably they should, but I don't think it's guaranteed that they do.
