I wonder what the value of those made-up studies that prove a point. Do they actually convince anyone? Do they cause more harm than good?

A Texas legislator  got a bill passed that honored the Boston Strangler for "population control" to proof that no one read the bills. https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/texas-boston-strangler/

There was  also a study of chocolate being  good for you. It was  done  to show that  the media  would publish anything.

James Lindsay has publish  a  bunch  of bogus studies: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grievance_studies_affair
What was  the  affect? Did any of these do  good?
