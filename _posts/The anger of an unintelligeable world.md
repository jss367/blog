I see people share articles about someone spoofing technology with glee. As if to show these technology people that they're not so smart. They created fake traffic jams by pulling a wagon full of cell phones. Haha what fun. But what if, instead of this or hacking into driverless cars, they show that if you chip away the supports it reduces the structural integrity. Much less funny now, right? Why is that? I mean, fundamentally why is that. There's some reason that exists below the surface. 
I think it's tribal. I think it's an "us versus them" and people just like making the them look like (in their opinion) fools. " I showed that their system can be brokenâ€¦ They thought they were so smart, haha" 

Hacking - there's always a story about medical devices being hacked. You can hack someone's pacemaker and kill them. But that's murder. If you're going to murder someone, why not stick a knife in them? Or disable their brakes. Is it so no one finds you? Is that really the reason more people aren't murdering? I don't believe that.
