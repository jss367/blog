The drug dealers
The media is in the business of selling drugs. Thatâ€™s why there huge drug scandals where there are so many deaths can happen. What if another industry had caused that many deaths?

This is the complement to my piece about sexy problems. 

According to the CDC, "[in 2018, 67,367 drug overdose deaths occurred in the United States](https://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/data/statedeaths.html)". I know - I mentioned this same figure in my last post. That's OK. This figure needs to be discussed far more than it has been.
