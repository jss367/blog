CNNs are no closer to being conscious than a piece of paper that you write 1+1 on. It's just not there. I don't think I'll ever believe that something that can be done in excel could be considered conscious. As far as I know, every machine learning algorithm that has been invented could be done in Excel.
I guess the one thing that could change my mind is to see my mind being recreated in Excel... but then would I believe it? Even if you wrote a program that gave the exact same outputs as I did based on an input... would I think it had consciousness? Probably not.
