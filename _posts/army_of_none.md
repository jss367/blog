This is from army of none. 
The dangerous calculus of weapons. 
It's about preserving the status quo. It goes something like "we're not all dead yet so let's be very careful not to rock the boat" 
But the boat is MAd. What do you do? Build a bunch of destabilizing weapons? That sounds like a bad idea
This is based on a while bunch of game theory. A bunch of "given what we know, what is in my best interest"? "What is in their best interest". 
After the invention of nuclear weapons, the first strike capability became devistating. Think about it like this : what should they soviets do if they think a war is coming. Strike first and knock out their opponents capabilites. So what should the US do? Well, strike even before first, before the first sign of conflict? Do what should the soviets do? Strike even before that. This goes on and on and, as you can see, leads to a very unstable solution. Make war only possible if it's intentional. 
There's stable and unstable technology. There's also offensive and defensive technology. All of these combinations exist. 
Machine guns are defensive - they make it harder to take new ground. They favor defense, they favor the current status. 
Don't confuse defensive with "good" though. Machine guns were what made trench warfare - surely one of the greatest horrors known to humans - possible. 
Tanks are offensive. 
Nuclear subs are stabilizing, because they take away the first strike capability
Even if all the nuclear silos were destroyed, there's almost a guarantee that some subs would remain. They're too difficult to track
Abms are destabilizing, although defensive. There goes that second strike. They can't stop an overwhelming attack, but they could stop a few from a submarine. Once you had an abm, your first mover strike is back on. Knock out everything you can with your first strike and (you hope) the abm will take care of the response. 
That's why we had a treaty to ban them. It seems crazy to ban tyke defense and not the missile, but that's how this works. 
Nuclear power long range cruise missions are far more destabilizing
Satellites are stabilizing because you can check on the other people. In general intelligence is stabilizing. You know you'll have earning before they bulk up and try to get the upper hand. 
Stopping this Intel, especially by attacking satellites, would therefore be destabilizing. Placing a lot of nuclear weapons in space would be destabilizing, because the attack could come without sufficient warning. Without sufficient warning, how do you deal with false alarms? Ignoring reality for a moment, what's the optimal delivery time? In thinking longer would always be better. 15 minutes doesn't seem so long. Although one could argue that placing a few in space would be stabilizing, as that's your second strike. What about just one? 
Side question : what's the optimal nonzero number and distribution of nuclear weapons in the world? Everyone gets one? Us gets them all? Two global superpowers?
This is why we've tried to ban stuff with treaties. Outer space treaty. INF. Abm treaty

Underlying all of this is MAD - mutually assured destruction
