I've been noticing lots of pieces in the newpaper about how their readers (i.e. the left) should work harder to understand those  on the other side. While I'm not opposed to the idea, I *am* curious if right-wing outlets are pushing the same message - that those people on the other side have something to say, have something to say, and, potentially, one could even learn a thing or two from them.

This got me thinking, what is it I know that I think isn't widely known? The first thing that came to my mind was statistics. I don't mean a silly formula or two, I mean how to read and understand graphs, charts, etc., as well as an appreciation for uncertainly unlying things. One thing that I've noticed is when people talk about predicting elections. It's become quite a conversation piece with the rise of [538](

Things others could learn - expected value. Uncertainty. The best possible answer is 60-40… given all of the information available, that’s the final answer. Out of all the possibilities that could explain this state, 60 percent of them are 1 way and 40 percent are another.
