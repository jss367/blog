What happened to the fundamental benefit of trade? Why are computers making everyone richer?

Why is infrasturcture so bad? In theory, it should be, we have computers and spreadsheets, therefore we do better. Our textbooks are better. Our teaching methods are better. Our engineers are better... why not? We have CAD. Why isn't there a CAD revolution?

Is this all due to regulations? And fewer people dying?

I didn't look into the details of these, but here are some common examples. Sure, there's more complexity, but I don't think it's far off.
Fast example: New York subway - time and cost; compare that to today - second ave subway cost 4.45 billion.



What fundamentally went wrong with the notion that you trade for a computer, the computer makes you more efficient? Sure, there's some leisure goods in there.
One thing that's interesting is the morman wealth fund. Maybe this is the result of actually accrewing the gains of productivity?

Also, why are poor countries so poor? A lot of people would say evil, but I don't think that's the full explanation. Certainly, it happened and was wide spread, but what about in polynesia? what caused it there? Why is it poor because it's small? Shouldn't it be rich because it's small, like Luxembourg.



I've noticed this with code bases as well. When I'm fast and free on my own code base at home, I'm much faster. But for some reason when using all these tools that were supposed to make me faster, I'm much slower with a big code base. Big teams as well. One or two people banging away on a problem... incredible results.


Getting water to FLint Michigan, or fixing it to the natual parks... i can understand the cost.

Has anyone figured out what to do? Maybe the mormon church with their slush fund?


How far does this trend go?
