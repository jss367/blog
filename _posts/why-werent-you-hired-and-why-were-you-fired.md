why weren't you hired/ why were you fired

this distribution is very different
i have heard many people say they didn't hire someone because they thought they were arrogant. that is something i am always on the workout for. someone arrogant might bring down the whole team. it's very dangerous to hire someone arrogant.
but no one ever tells me they didn't get hired because they were arrogant.
the current status quo is to say "the fit isn't right". i don't know what the best option is. i don't think this is it. i give feedback (usually it's their programming skills)
