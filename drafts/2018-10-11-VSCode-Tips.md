 First, here's how to access the settings:
  * Open the Command Palette: `CMD/CTRL + SHIFT + P`
  * You can use either the User Interface (`Preferences: Open Settings (UI)`) or edit the JSON directly `Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)`. 
    * You can also jump to the settings or Command Palette by clicking on the settings wheel in the bottom left corner.
* You can see (and copy) all the extensions and settings I use in my [Visual Studio Code Settings Sync Gist](https://gist.github.com/jss367/6574f6940f7c9603ffd949f42ca4f205)



User settings are not stored in the project. Instead, they are at: C:\Users\Julius\AppData\Roaming\Code\User\settings.json
