Being in the Spotlight (Or Not)




I saw that a huge leak existed in Duck Duck Go, a popular search engine, especially for privacy advocates. It's funny how serious the bug is and how little attention it got. If this same thing had happened with a famous company, it could have been major news. But I guess Duck Duck Go doesn't have the name-brand recognition to be worth it, so they get a pass by major news sources. Interesting to think about what would have been the case had something comparable been done with Google.

Another thing that got WAY to little attenion was the vulnerability with Linux.

Hitting the backspace key 28 times would have essentially logged you into a Linux machine. And the vulnerability existed for a while.
