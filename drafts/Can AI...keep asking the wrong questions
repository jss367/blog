Can AI ... keep asking the wrong questions?


I have repeatedly written about the overusage of AI. This stems from the overhype that AI is currently experiencing. I think it's resulting in a lot of bad questions about it. Most of the questions of the form "Can AI do X" are poorly formed and do much to propagate nonsensical notions of what AI is. This is a click-bait title that propagates misunderstanding of AI. In particuar, in proagates the belief that asking if AI can do X is a meaningful question. It is not.



For example, there seems to a spate of articles with the construction of something like "Can AI help you find love?". These articles are generally about dating apps that allow you to answer questions about yourself (demographic and otherwise, such as are you interested in politics) and match you up based on that. 



Can ai help you find love? Just linear regression


I recently listened to a podcast by Intelligence Squared US called "[Can AI Change Your Mind?](https://www.wnyc.org/story/intelligence-squared-us-can-ai-change-your-mind/)". 


Can AI change your mind? Yes, by reading Wikipedia to you
Can ai change your mind? Wikipedia can. Can you call in love with ai? I feel in love with a stuffed bear
