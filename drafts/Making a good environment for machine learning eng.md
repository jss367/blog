Making a good environment for machine learning engineers


Make people PROUD to work there

Implement a vision that is shared, but also excellent. Depending on the seniority of the team, it may be more or less shared. But it must be excellent. Don't let those get flipped.

Always have some research
- possibility of patents, publishing
-- publish things that you can explain without revealing too much; patent the rest
-- You can patent within a year of publishing


have a good and a constant stream of content

Make sure there's an expert on the team. Everyone should be learning. If everyone can learn from one or two experts, that's great. Those experts should be expert enough to learn from research papersor trying new things.


Have data engineers. You need more than you have. People are happier doing their assigned roles then other roles, even if the work is the same. Hire a data engineer. Don't want the ML teams burried in data the whole time.

Product drives direction, but ML teams get a seat at the table

Get feedback and respond quickly. Live surveys are good. Get info then do.


Hardware resources:
8 is the default for detectron2?
- also gives better accuracy because higher learning rate
