Missing words in english

In general, I support more words in the sense that if a word refers to two completely different concepts, they should be different words. For example, in Australia, the word "torch" means both "flashlight" and "torch". These are two very different things and unless you want to set your tent on fire I think it makes sense to have two different terms for these two different concepts. Note, I'm not referring to homographs like "minute" and "minute"; I'm referring to single words.

There is no way when using the first person plural to tell whether the second person ("you") is included in the statement. "We're going to a party. We're all in this together." Am I invited? And I in this with you? It's not clear because "we" doesn't distinguish between "I and other people and you" and "I and other people and NOT you". There should be separate words for each.

Spatula should not refer to two different things. Sometimes it's used as in what you would use to scrap the last bits of peanut butter out of a jar, and sometimes it refers to what is used to flip pancakes. Two different meanings. Should be two different words.


Past tense of ought. Perhaps there are alternatives, like "should have". But if the distinction between "ought" and "should" is significant enough to have two words in present tense, why wouldn't it have two words in the past tense?
