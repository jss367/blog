Status Quo Bias

I believe the status quo bias, that is, a preference for things that already exist, is the strongest, and possibly least discusses, bias of all. I see it so commonly but it's rarely included on a list of biases. 

Why don't people wear their seatbelts on buses? At the risk of sounding trite, I think the answer is "because they don't", or, at least, "because they didn't yesterday". If you ask someone, you might hear some specious claim about the number of accidents that buses are in, but let me ask you this. If due to advancements in car safety technology dropped the accident level to whatever it is with buses, would people stop wearing seat belts in the same situations (e.g. mostly city driving) when in a car? No. It would still be unthinkable to not wear a perfect seatbelt. By the way, I've also noticed on long distances buses running on the highway people still don't wear seatbelts. I've argued before that [most arguments people make to explain their reason are almost completely ex post rationalizations and mostly wrong](). Because people just say the first argument that comes to their mind that sounds true (in a Kahneman system 1 way). Or you might hear something about how the seat in front of you is closer to it's less dangerious. Again, this is complete nonsense - no one does these measurements and uses the same logic for cars.

People don't wear seatbelts in buses simple because that's what they're used it. It's complete status quo bias.


Another example is the [complexity of language](). Why do we put up with language this complex? Well, as I argued earlier, partly it's because we learn most languages as children. But also it's the status quo.
