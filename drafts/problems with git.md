problems with git

git checkout is overloaded
git checkout -b to create a new branch
git checkout . should be git clear or something

it's too easy for a new user to get in a detached head state
is it too much to read all the  documentation? honestly, I think it is. for a  beginner user that's a lot and unlikely to happen
