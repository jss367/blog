two completely different worlds



the left and right have different version of the muslim kid who got in trouble for building a clock that the school thought was a bomb


the left thinks he got in trouble because of anti-muslim sentiment


the right thinks obama brought someone who built a bomb into a school to the white house because it didn't want to offend any muslims


and live just went on... with people in two different worlds.

They worlds collide though. We're going to make a decision about who should be president next, and the truth to the question about is highly relevant.

This is so concerning. I think this is disasterous for a country. I don't see how this fixes itself. It just seems like it's going to get worse and worse.
