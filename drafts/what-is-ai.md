What is AI?

The poorly defined term artificial intelligence covers a set of disciplines that have
been subjected to a tremendous amount of research, scrutiny, confusion, fantastical hype, and sci-fi fearmongering. Reality is, of course, far more sanguine. It would
be disingenuous to assert that today’s machines are learning to “think” in any
human sense of the word. Rather, we’ve discovered a general class of algorithms that are able to approximate complicated, nonlinear processes very, very effectively,
which we can use to automate tasks that were previously limited to humans
