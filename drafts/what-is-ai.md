What is AI?

The poorly defined term artificial intelligence covers a set of disciplines that have
been subjected to a tremendous amount of research, scrutiny, confusion, fantastical hype, and sci-fi fearmongering. Reality is, of course, far more sanguine. It would
be disingenuous to assert that today’s machines are learning to “think” in any
human sense of the word. Rather, we’ve discovered a general class of algorithms that are able to approximate complicated, nonlinear processes very, very effectively,
which we can use to automate tasks that were previously limited to humans

We've conflated intelligence with being human in many ways. For example, is self-awareness necessary. You can performa a lot of tasks without self-awareness.



the question of whether Machines Can Think, a question of which we now know that it is about as relevant as the question of whether Submarines Can Swim

They'll be able to think in the way submarines can swim. It's not exactly what we had in mind, but it's incredibly effective. They're not swimming to stay alive, and they won't swim on their own.
