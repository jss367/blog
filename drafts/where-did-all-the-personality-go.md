Where did the personality go? 


What law of the universe insists that all companies in a given sector should be identical? For example, I can't tell the difference between rental car companies. They all seem to have the exact same policies, at the exact same locations, doing the exact same things.

When I was looking for a moving company to ship my stuff, I found the same thing. They all advertise "free quote" and make you put in information. You put in information about what your shipping (number of rooms, furnished or unfurnished, etc.) - enough so you THINK they'll actually give you a quote. But after you put this in and submit, instead of returning with a quote, they call or email you. They all decided that a "bait-and-switch" - make them think they'll get an easy quote then call them to force them to invest time and discourage price shopping. Five different companies in a row. What's going on here? If there was one company that actually gave me a quote they would stick out - and I think I'd be much more likely to go with them.

Some sectors, notably tech, make companies with very different personalities. Apple has more customer devices, Amazon leads in the cloud, and Microsoft does desktops. Yes, there's a lot of overlap for sure. But the companies are definitely uniquely different.


Is this the result of a Nash Equilibrium?
