why does ai not do more good
you be in business, you have to create wealthto get paid, you have to create value to the world

maybe you do that by making a search engine better, or adding voice recognition
what if you improved everyone's education. would that create wealth? It creates a lot of value, possibly more than anyone else is, but is it creating wealth?
I'll give you a simple notion of wealth creation. If you reduce the amount of cost it takes to make a transaction, like provide insurance, you've created wealth. but if you've improved education or criminal justice, it doesn't directly create wealth. it certainly creates value, but not wealth. so you have to think about how to do that.
the environment is another good example. tax and dividend would improve this.
i've written before about the benefits of placing costs on things (see horseshoe crabs)... or, more accurately, the harm in the delicate balance we have of living in a capitalist society where many valuable goods remain without a price tag.
should we price everything? should we pay money to people for raising their kids? this seems gross to most, but economists routinely put a value on human life. but is there a limit? it seems gross to me too
