Why is language so complex

## Masculinity vs Femininity

The more I learn about language the more convinced I am that it is wildly more complex than it needs to be. I remember learning Spanish and for every noun you have to memorize whether it is masculine or feminine. I have asked many people what the value of this is and the answers range between "it's part of the language" to "you just don't get it" which, to me, sounds like another way of saying it doesn't add any value.

## Conjugating verbs

This was another one I learned when asking how it was done in another language. I learned that in Chinese, they don't conjugate verbs. Then I started wondering, why do I conjugate verbs? Why can't I say "I run yesterday", "I run tomorrow". This seems perfectly fine with me. At first it sounds wrong to me, but I *think* that's just due to expecting the other. I bet if we started from scratch we could remove conjugation with no loss.

## Tonality

Mandarin Chinese, however, has tonality. Why? Again, I think the answer is just "because". Everything I have ever expressed in language has been done without tonality, so it's difficult to convince me that we need it. I say get rid of it.

## Why does it remain complex?

I don't think it became complex by design. I think it was bit by bit. And most language is learned as a child when our ability to learn language is one of the most incredible things in the history of intelligence. And the other time is as an adult, and I can't go around asking Chinese speakers to kindly remove tonality from their language so it's easy for me to learn. So, it remains complex.

I do think, with enough people learning a language as a second language, this might act as a force to reduce the language's complexity. I'm curious if languages that very few people learn as second languages are more complex that those that are commonly learned as second languages.

## The Simplest Language

The simplest language... Probably some form of pidgin language.
